# Virtual-Memory-Hit-Miss
This program functions as an ability to check hits and misses on a virtual memory stack based on memory allocation.


This program runs on 4 Processes for memory. Using a file the program will read in which process should be used, and a value for the process to intake. This will then decide if it is a hit or a miss based on whether the value is in the memory process or not. At the end of the file, the program will calculate the hit/miss percentage for all 4 processes as well as the overall hit/miss percentage of all 4 combined to show the effectiveness of the memory.

Compile the program using Java compiler.

to run:
java virtualMemory Arg1 Arg2 Arg3 Arg4 Arg5

Arg1 is the file for the program to read from.
Arg2 is the size of memory for Process 1.
Arg3 is the size of memory for Process 2.
Arg4 is the size of memory for Process 3.
Arg5 is the size of memory for Process 4.
